# 🍽️ Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis

## 📖 Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing public sentiment from restaurant reviews, sourced from Kaggle. The dataset consists of customer opinions, star ratings, and timestamps, offering insights into dining experiences across numerous restaurants.

## 🎯 Objective
The main goal is to gain insights into customer sentiment trends and build models that can accurately classify review sentiment into positive, neutral, or negative categories.

## 🧰 Models Used
Four models are tested for sentiment classification:

1. Logistric Regression
2. Naive Bayes
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Distiled Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (DistilBERT)
   
## 📊 Result Highlights
- Result 1
- Result 2
- Result 3

## 🔮 Future Work
- Test larger Transformer models like BERT and RoBERTa for better performance
- Use more data augmentation and include external sentiment data to enrich the dataset
- Apply explainable AI methods to better understand model decisions
